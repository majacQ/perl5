/*
 * This file contains mathoms, various binary artifacts from previous
 * versions of Perl which we cannot completely remove from the core
 * code. There is only one reason these days for functions should be here:
 *
 * 1) A function has been replaced by a macro within a minor release,
 *    so XS modules compiled against an older release will expect to
 *    still be able to link against the function
 *
 * It used to be that this was the way to handle the case were a function
 * Perl_foo(...) had been replaced by a macro.  But see the 'm' flag discussion
 * in embed.fnc for a better way to handle this.
 *
 * This file can't just be cleaned out periodically, because that would break
 * builds with -DPERL_NO_SHORT_NAMES
 *
 * NOTE: ALL FUNCTIONS IN THIS FILE should have an entry with the 'b' flag in
 * embed.fnc.
 *
 * To move a function to this file, simply cut and paste it here, and change
 * its embed.fnc entry to additionally have the 'b' flag.  If, for some reason
 * a function you'd like to be treated as mathoms can't be moved from its
 * current place, simply enclose it between
 *
 * #ifndef NO_MATHOMS
 *    ...
 * #endif
 *
 * and add the 'b' flag in embed.fnc.
 *
 * The compilation of this file and the functions within it can be suppressed
 * by adding this option to Configure:
 *
 *      -Accflags='-DNO_MATHOMS'
 *
 * Some of the functions here are also deprecated.

=for apidoc_section $unicode
=for apidoc utf8_to_uvuni

Returns the Unicode code point of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding; C<retlen> will be set to the
length, in bytes, of that character.

Some, but not all, UTF-8 malformations are detected, and in fact, some
malformed input could cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer, which
is one reason why this function is deprecated.  The other is that only in
extremely limited circumstances should the Unicode versus native code point be
of any interest to you.

If C<s> points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set (if C<retlen> doesn't point to
NULL) to -1.  If those warnings are off, the computed value if well-defined (or
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>
is set (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr> for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.

code, so this function is quite unlikely to be what you want.  If you do need
